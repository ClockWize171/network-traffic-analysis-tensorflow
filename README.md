## Network Traffics Analysis with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
In this project, three differents types of network traffic datasets will be analyzed with both machine learning and deep learning. The three different type of network traffic datasets are:
1. NSL-KDD dataset
2. CIC-IDS2017 dataset
3. Android Malware dataset.

## Used datasets
- NSL-KDD dataset. 'https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html'
- CIC-IDS2017 download and ()
- Android Malware dataset ()

## Used algorithms 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
