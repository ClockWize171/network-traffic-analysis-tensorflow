## Network Traffics Analysis with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
In this project, three differents types of network traffic datasets will be analyzed with both machine learning and deep learning. The three different type of network traffic datasets are:
1. NSL-KDD dataset
2. CIC-IDS2017 dataset
3. Datasets that is captured by BRIM app.

## Used datasets
